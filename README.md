# Modular Maze Navigator


### ðŸ“· Detection of 3D-Maze
using live webcam feed of maze to analyze maze layout
: opencv, numpy, pythonbuildgui

### ðŸ§  Solving maze using reinforcement learning#
Calculate path of current maze for the agent to take


### ðŸ“ˆ Visualisation of learning progress
using -lib- to show agents actions and progress over time

: opencv, numpy, pythonbuildgui


### ðŸ¤– Controlling MindStorm EV3 to navigate through maze
give moving instructions to agent 

Used libraries:
(host): mobaXterm (ssh connection to ev3), etcher (ev3 img flasher), ev3dev-stretch, evdev2
(ev3): rpyc (3.3.0), python (3.5.3)

it is possible to automatically start the server when booting up the ev3 brick. However this is not done here, to be able to see the communication on mobaXterm


### Setup

For convenience, we advise to use Conda Virtual Environments.
After installing anaconda, create a new environment using:
`conda create -n <env-name> python=3.5` and activate it using `conda activate <env-name>`.
Now navigate into the project "/MazeSolver" (`cd */MazeSolver`) and  run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to automatically install all required libaries.

To run the program, make sure a birds-eye-view picture of a maze is in the `/input` folder. Next boot the ev3 brick and pair it via Bluetooth with the HOst PC, then start mobaxterm to run `bash rpyc_server.sh`. After the server started, run the main python script using `python main.py`
